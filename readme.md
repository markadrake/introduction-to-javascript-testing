# Introduction to JavaScript Testing

The goal of this code repository is to provide developers (with varying degrees of expertise, as well as experience) the shortest path for writing unit tests in JavaScript.

## Requirements

Requirements for running this project are quite limited. [If your operating system supports running Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), you can run this project. We recommend if this is your first time using Node.js or if you plan to use this in a production environment â€“ download and install the latest long-term support [LTS] version.

**Requirements:**

- **Node.js**
  - A JavaScript runtime with native support for many platforms - Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS, etc.

## Dependencies

Once you've cloned this code repository, you'll need to open a command line or terminal to the folder you've cloned into. Running this command will install all dependencies required for the project:

```
npm i
```

*Node Package Manager is used in this example for sake of ease and simplicity. If you are using another package manager, like Yarn, by all means use the package manager you prefer.*

**Dependencies:**

- **Mocha**
  - A framework for testing JavaScript code, with support for running in both Node.js and the browser.
- **Chai**
  - A library that provides assertions, supporting both behavior-driven and test-driven development (BDD, TDD).
- **NYC** and **Istanbul**
  - A library that helps us track how well unit-tests exercise the codebase (code coverage).
